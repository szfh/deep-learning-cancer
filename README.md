# Breast cancer deep learning :snake:

### A project for the jHub Coding Scheme (JCS)

## Plan

1. Import dataset :heavy_check_mark:
1. Create `X` and `y` :heavy_check_mark:
1. **Data preprocessing** :arrow_forward:
	1. Replace datetimes with strings :heavy_check_mark:
	1. Replace ranges with mid point :heavy_check_mark:
	1. Handle missing values :heavy_check_mark:
	1. Encode catergorical variables :arrow_forward:
		1. Avoid the variable trap :question:
	1. Feature scaling :x:
	1. Split to `training` and `test` :x:

## Task

1. Using Python, create the best performing neural networks algorithm you can to predict recurrence rates of breast cancer based upon the variables provided in the attached breast cancer spreadsheet.
1. Document:
	1. the settings you tested (and rationale for the strategy you took) along the way to optimal performance.
	1. a screenshot of you using the trained algorithm to make a prediction on an unseen piece of data.
